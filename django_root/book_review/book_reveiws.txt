“The Legendary Shiver” By: J.H. MacAl

EDIT"“THE LEGENDARY SHIVER” BY: J.H. MACAL"
RATING: * * * * *

GENRE: Realistic Fiction/Romance

Raw, real, and tragic.

The Legendary Shiver is about a girl named Ruby who moves to a small town in Texas and meets a shy, lonely boy named Will. Their souls immediately recognize each other and connect on a deep level, forming an unbreakable friendship. Naturally, their friendship evolves into an even deeper love and is put to the test by the hardships of reality, coming to terms with the trauma’s of your past, and most of all accepting yourself. While Ruby fights for her dreams of being a famous singer, Will is always right there by her side and proves to be her rock over and over again. I’ll stop there, as this plot is better left discovered by its reader and their own journey through the pages. Therefore, you’ll have to read it for yourself to find out how this story ends, which I highly recommend.

It is one of the most refreshing novels I’ve read in quite some time. Something I find is very underrated about writing is when it’s made effortless. Meaning the words roll off your tongue and flow down the page. The words become your own thoughts and the actual act of reading requires little to no effort. Not only is it special when it happens, but it is very rare in today’s novels. However, MacAl captures it wonderfully while also covering a multitude of themes such as love, depression, acceptance, and loss.

It is about humanity as well as the painful realities and sacrifices that come with trying to make it as an artist in today’s world. I empathized with each character because of the depth and crafty composure by MacAl that draws you in and opens you up to the relatable experiences they are going through. He does this by using human emotion, raw and beautiful, to connect his readers to the characters. For example, you don’t have to be a struggling singer to feel Ruby’s sacrifice and pain because it comes from a much deeper level inside of her. Her true pain comes from her abuse as a child, the abandonment she feels, and her own insecurities.

Several times during my reading, I found myself connecting with various characters and on different levels. This. Is. What. Reading. Is. About. It’s about breaking down your walls and learning about yourself through others. It’s about being vulnerable and empathizing with what the characters are going through. A good book should allow you to grow as an individual and accept others for who they are, which is exactly what The Legendary Shiver does.

“The Killing Tide” By: Dani Pettrey

LYLA LAYNE
EDIT"“THE KILLING TIDE” BY: DANI PETTREY"
RATING: * * * *

GENRE: Mystery/Thriller/Romance

I really enjoyed this novel and the best way to explain what it is like is to relate it to a guilty pleasure TV show.

Let me preface by saying this is not a bad thing at all. The reason for that is because it was addicting and I didn’t want to put it down. At the same time, it had some cliche suspense/romance plot choices, a lack of depth, and not everything was believable or realistic. However, it’s one of those books where you don’t care about that because you’re so wrapped up in what’s going to happen next. Now do you see the connection to guilty pleasures?

The novel is about a reporter named Gabby who had just done a report on a well-known drug dealer named Fuentes, which lead to his arrest and investigation into his dealings. After he attempts a hit on her life, she returns back to her hometown in North Carolina and stays with a past lover, Finn. Instantly, her feelings return for him and they are back where they started in a messy decision on how to handle their love.

Meanwhile, her brother Noah, who leads a coastguard investigative service team that Finn is also on, is running a parallel investigation about stolen art, jewelry, and drug trafficking. Little by little, the cases unravel and begin to connect as a larger player starts to surface.

This page-turner will keep you on the edge of your seat as you wait for what unfolds. My only critique here is the prayers/thoughts to God that are randomly placed throughout the novel. These needed more context and development in order to be included, otherwise, it just felt a bit too out of place. The idea was there, the execution was not.

I would recommend reading this novel if you’re looking for a good guilty pleasure, page-turner, or vacation read.

“The Museum of Extraordinary Things” By: Alice Hoffman
MAY 14, 2020
LYLA LAYNE
EDIT"“THE MUSEUM OF EXTRAORDINARY THINGS” BY: ALICE HOFFMAN"
RATING: ***

GENRE: Historical Fiction/Romance

I chose to read this book because Jodi Picoult, my favorite author, had mentioned Alice Hoffman as being one of her favorite authors. Sadly, I was a bit disappointed by this one; although, I will definitely be reading another book by Hoffman in the near future.

There is nothing wrong with the writing itself, I just did not connect with the plot as I had hoped. It’s a very creative and interesting idea, but there is too much going on which disconnects depth from the storyline and characters.

This novel is about a young girl named Coralie, the daughter of a horrible man who runs the Museum of Extraordinary Things in Coney Island. Coralie was born with a birth defect that gave her webbed hands, which her father takes advantage of and forces her to swim the Hudson River at night – spreading fear that a monster is lurking in its depths.

Meanwhile, a Russian immigrant, Eddie Cohen, has his own story unraveling as he investigates the death of a young woman from the jewish community he abandoned years ago. Through her death, he exposes unsettling details about the treatment of immigrants during this time and the sad conditions in which they were forced to work for very little pay.

The investigation of the woman’s death leads Eddie to Coralie’s father and his love for Coralie instantly sparks. She returns that same love for him and begins to realize the evil that lies within her father (if he even truly is her father). I won’t give away the ending, but I will let you know it includes fire, death, truth, and love.

The problem for me with this novel was that there were two different storylines happening at the same time intertwined by the forced connection of the young woman found dead by the river. Hoffman did a wonderful job developing Eddie and giving readers an insight into his past and why he’s become who he is. However, the love between him and Coralie was too sudden for me.

Don’t get me wrong, I love a good love story, but I want to feel and believe it as well. I wish this had been divided into two separate novels. I would have loved to read a whole book just on Eddie Cohen and his past as well as the narrative of other Russian immigrants during a time where immigrant workers were not treated fairly. This is what drew me in and was extremely interesting, but it got lost amongst the other story going on about the Museum of Extraordinary Things.

I’ll end this review by saying that there still was insightful themes between immigrants at that time and the “creatures” of the Museum. I’ll leave that open to interpretation for other readers and would love to here what you uncover.

As always, happy reading.

“The Last Letter” By: Rebecca Yarros

LYLA LAYNE
EDIT"“THE LAST LETTER” BY: REBECCA YARROS"
RATING: * * * * *

GENRE: Realistic fiction/Romance

I don’t know where to begin, this book was such a breath of fresh air. This is genuinely one of my favorite novels that I’ve read in a long time. I laughed out loud, I cried, and I fell in love with the characters. It is such a rare and unique trait for writers to be able to include all of that into a single novel, and Rebecca executed it perfectly.

She reaches such a depth with these characters, while also utilizing amazing writing techniques, such as the letters at the beginning of the chapters. These small additions keep the plot fast paced and intriguing.

The novel is about a woman named Ella who has been through hell and back. After losing almost everyone she loves, her daughter Maisie is diagnosed with neuroblastoma cancer. At the same time, a former pen pal of hers, and best friend of her late brother, shows up with his military dog, Havoc, to be the support system Ella’s never had.

They fight life’s battles together and fall deeply in love, while also uncovering who they truly are. A devastating event occurs that I will leave for all you to find out on your own. However, this is the one part of the novel that I think it could have been better off without. It’s not that I need a happy ending, but the book was so full and fulfilling without needing to add the twist at the end. It felt more forced than anything.

Overall, this is a must read and I hope all my fellow readers can appreciate it as much as I did.

“To Live” By: C.G. Cooper
JANUARY 8, 2020
LYLA LAYNE
EDIT"“TO LIVE” BY: C.G. COOPER"
RATING: * *

GENRE: Realistic Fiction

This is an extremely fast read and doesn’t contain too much depth. I felt like I was reading and watching the events take place from above, but never actually immersed in the text.

The novel is about death, life, loss, and family. Three themes that if you take them on, you need the plot and writing skills to back them up. Unfortunately, this novel doesn’t have either to execute this properly. It’s about a man named Elmore Thaddeus Nix who recently lost his wife and has just found out he has cancer. He gratefully welcomes death until an unexpected young girl name Sam enters his life.

Through Sam we find out more about Elmore and the secrets that he’s been keeping from us. We also witness Sam unlock something deep inside Elmore that awakens his will to live and beat cancer. I definitely liked the overall message of this story, but what lacked most for me was the surface level writing that never allows us as readers to get emotionally involved into the novel. Certain events that occured seemed unbelievable and cheesy, causing me to feel fairly detached from the rest of the storyline.

I wouldn’t recommend this novel to most readers.

“Shelter in Place” By: Nora Roberts

LYLA LAYNE
EDIT"“SHELTER IN PLACE” BY: NORA ROBERTS"
RATING: * * * *

GENRE: Mystery/Thriller

This is yet another mystery by Nora Roberts that I’ve thoroughly enjoyed. She has a true talent for incorporating suspense and romance subtly into her novels. They pull you further and further into the storyline until the climax hits you in the face.

This novel is about a mall shooting that takes place in a small town. If the pain of the past isn’t already enough, as these survivors grow up, they find out that the true mastermind behind the shooting is still alive and counting down the days before she begins her next big plan – taking out the remaining survivors one by one.

Meanwhile, two of the survivors, Simone and Reed, find themselves falling deeply in love. Unfortunately, they are also at the top of Patricia Hobart’s list, leading to one final and dramatic face-off between all of them.

I would recommend this book due to the thrilling nature of it. It’s the kind of book you won’t want to put down. The plot keeps its fast pace throughout the novel, never letting readers get bored or lose interest. It is also very relatable to today’s world and the lifetime of pain shootings like these leave behind.

“The Only Woman in the Room” By: Marie Benedict
JUNE 26, 2019
LYLA LAYNE
EDIT"“THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE ROOM” BY: MARIE BENEDICT"
RATING: * * *

GENRE: Historical Fiction

I’m torn with this novel. Is it well-written? Yes. Is it interesting? Yes. Does it contain bundles of historical information while keeping the narrative going? Yes.

So, you may be wondering then why I gave it three stars and the answer is this – Marie Benedict is capable of much more than the final draft of this novel. In a previous review, I praised Carnegie’s Maid, by Marie Benedict, for how wonderful and enjoyable it was. With The Only Woman in the Room however, it lacks the intrigue and irresistibility that I know Benedict is capable of.

This novel is about a woman, Hedy, who loves to act and is living in Austria before WWII. Through her popular theatre career, she catches the unwarranted attention of the most powerful man in Austria. Day after day he pursues her until finally they are to be married. Unfortunately for her, his power stems from evil friendships and day-to-day work that is horrifying to her and her Jewish descent.

Without giving too much away – Hedy must take on the hardest acting role of all to be his wife and plan an escape at the same time.

The narrative jumps around too much. While a lot of time must be covered, readers still need to feel connected and involved in what they are reading. When a narrative jumps around as much as this one, while also throwing a lot of historical and scientific information at its’ readers, it is too hard for them to make the novel their world.

I wouldn’t recommend this novel to anyone, although I wouldn’t discourage it either. It is simply an interesting read that ties in history and fiction to make the past come to life.

“The Night Olivia Fell” By: Christina McDonald
JUNE 19, 2019
LYLA LAYNE
EDIT"“THE NIGHT OLIVIA FELL” BY: CHRISTINA MCDONALD"
RATING: * *

GENRE: Mystery/thriller

This was another book that was included in the monthly Scriblr box I used to be subscribed to. As you all may know, I tend to be on the softer side with my reviews. However, it’s time I take a step back and truly analyze the book for what it is.

This novel is about a mother, Abi, whose daughter fell from a bridge and is in a coma. The doctor’s say she will never wake up, but they must keep her on life support until her (spoiler) baby is born. Everyone keeps saying it was an accident, but Abi doesn’t believe them. She won’t rest until she finds her daughters killer. In the process, she unravels secrets about her life and her daughter that make her question everything.

When it comes to this novel, it needed a few more rounds of editing. For my writers out there, take note because it’s a perfect example of too much “telling” and not enough “showing.” Several times, the thrill and suspense is broken up by McDonald telling us thoughts and side events over and over again. It was to the point that my eyes would glaze over these parts towards the end because I already knew what they were going to say.

You should NEVER have to tell your readers the same characteristics or thoughts of your characters over and over again. You should show these thoughts or events with the small details that you include. For example, in this novel, instead of constantly saying how abandoned Abi feels from her childhood, SHOW what this abandonment looks like. SHOW what this sadness looks like. With a few more rounds of edits, this novel could be really amazing. The plot is there, the characters are there, and the thrill is there.

I wouldn’t recommend this novel as of now, due to its lack of edits and inability to condense the unnecessary “telling” elements.

EDIT"“THE NIGHTINGALE” BY: KRISTIN HANNAH"
RATING: * * * *

GENRE: Historical Fiction

Wow. I don’t know where to begin with this novel. While the first half took me much longer to get through than a typical book ever has, the second half absolutely blew me away and brought me to tears.

It is about two sister’s, Isabelle and Vianne, who fight their way to survive in WWII. Isabelle, the more rebellious one, becomes the infamous “Nightingale,” who helps downed enemy airmen escape from the German forces in France. She uses her beauty and men’s ignorance to do the impossible in a time of paranoia and death. Along the way, she finds herself falling in love and realizing how much that love means to her.

In Le Jardin, Vianne must fight for the safety of her daughter, Sophie, and the other innocent lives around her. Through it all, she has two German soldiers (one after the other) who are billeted at her home. She must watch her step with everything she does. Her rebellious spirit picks up throughout the war as she witnesses more and more injustices done to her people and the ones she loves.

This novel is about love and sorrow. It is about women and their role in the war. Is is about courage and strength. It is about humanity – the horrors of it as well as the miracles.

Read this novel to reaffirm your own humanity and the places in which we’ve all come from. It will give you insight into yourself, as well as those around you. And if you’re like me, you just might be brought to tears by the courage of those in the novel as well as the pain they’ve gone through. Through all of that pain, they still were able to find joy.

That simple yet complex entity is what life is all about.

“Carnegie’s Maid” By: Marie Benedict

LYLA LAYNE
EDIT"“CARNEGIE’S MAID” BY: MARIE BENEDICT"
RATING: * * * * *

GENRE: Historical Fiction

Don’t be thrown off by the title when it comes to this novel. Some people want fiction, not history – I get that. BUT, whether you like historical fiction, realistic fiction, romance, mystery, whatever it may be, I guarantee you will still enjoy this book.

Let me stray away for a second and praise Marie Benedict for the amazing author that she is. She has a knack for taking an instance from history, and building her own fiction around it. By the end of her books, you’ll have yourself questioning if it could have truly happened. I’m looking forward to reading her newest book, “The Only Woman in the Room.”

With “Carnegie’s Maid,” it is about an Irish immigrant, Clara Kelly, who is shipped of to America and finds herself easily swept away into a life that was meant for a different ‘Clara Kelly’ (something which probably was very common back then due to the heavy migration to America at that time). Under this impersonation, she becomes a lady’s maid to Andrew Carnegie’s mother.

After a few encounters, Andrew can’t take his mind off of Clara and neither can she. Unlike other lady maid’s, she has a knack for reading and literature taught to her by her father. Her and Andrew share multiple forbidden walks together where they are truly able to delve into their honest opinions.

Then, something happens and the two are forced to be split from each other. I can’t spoil the ending, so you’ll have to read the novel to find out exactly what happens. What becomes of the woman who has changed Andrew Carnegie forever, and caused his sudden vow to charitable functions?

This story is so beautifully written, in diction and in detail. Marie makes you feel like you are in that time period and a part of the Carnegie household.

This is a must read! 🙂

EDIT"“CIRCLE OF SHADOWS” BY: EVELYN SKYE"
RATING: * * *

GENRE: Fantasy

This was the January novel sent in the Scriblr box that I’ve mentioned in earlier posts. Honestly, I’m not really sure where I stand with it. I’m not too big into fantasy anymore ( as I’ve also previously mentioned). In addition, I believe this book would be geared towards a younger audience.

With that being said, did I enjoy it still? Yes. Will I read the sequel? No. Would I recommend it? Only to the appropriate audience.

It has a good fluid plot that builds appropriate momentum with dynamic characters. DYNAMIC! Such a hard thing to find in novels, now-a-days.

The novel is about a fantasy land called Kinochan, where Empress Akia rules. Her evil brother, who she thought has been dead, Prince Gin, has come back ten years later to try and take the crown back. Sora, Damean, Fairy, and Broomstick … if those names don’t say YA, I don’t know what does …. are “taigas,” soldiers chosen at birth by the Luna god, and they are the only hope to defeat Prince Gin.

In the meantime, Sora finds out her sister, Hana, may not be dead after all. The book leaves you in a cliffhanger after the evil prince has charged the citadel. What will be the fate of Kinochan? You are left still unsure about this answer.

P.S. you’re going to be rooting for Sora and Damean to end up together the whole time.

EDIT"“THE WOMEN IN THE CASTLE” BY: JESSICA SHATUCK"
RATING: * * * *

GENRE: Historical Fiction

Another WWII novel! (can you tell how much I love these kind of books yet). Okay, to start … if you’re deciding between this and “Lilac Girls,” by Martha Hall Kelly, read “Lilac Girls” every time. However, this novel is also extremely enjoyable and unique in its’ own way. It drifts away from that same cliche WWII novel, and takes us into new narratives and forms of writing.

With any novel in this genre, it takes a bit of time to get into, but is very satisfying upon completion. It’s unique in that it tells the story long before the war, long after the war, as well as during the actual war. Sometimes, WWII novels lack the “afterward.” What happens to these people after the unimaginable trauma they already had to go through? How does one “re-build” humanity?

Throughout the whole novel, you are alternated between narratives of the past, present, and future, which forces you to piece together the connections and events while you are reading. Personally, I love this form and find it to be very well done in this particular novel.

This novel mainly follows the narrative of three women; Benita, Marianne, and Ania. The husbands of two of them, Benita & Marianne, were resistors of Hitler and tried to assassinate him, while Ania’s husband was a Nazi. All three of the women end up living in Burg Lindenfel Castle together after the war as they try to rebuild their lives. After a few years, they eventually go their own ways, and it becomes a story of those new lives as well.

Overall, the diction and flow of this story is beautifully written. It shows the hardships that women and children had to go through during this time and what humanity truly means. It also gives insight to “the other side,” of things; in some ways due to the fact that it is from women’s perspectives, but also in other ways as none of them are Jewish or “direct” victims from the Nazi’s.

Therefore, I would definitely recommend this book for it’s uniqueness and plot as a whole.

GENRE: Realistic Fiction/Mystery

I came away from this book a little unsure with how I felt about it. It took me a VERY long time to truly get into it, but towards the end I was thoroughly enjoying it. Therefore, I’m giving it three stars because I wouldn’t outright recommend it, but I wouldn’t necessarily discourage it either.

It’s about a young girl, Kya, who is known as the “marsh girl.” She is only ten years old when her whole family abandons her to fend for herself in the marsh in North Carolina in the 1960s. Uneducated, dirty, and wild, the townspeople neglect her, make up rumors, and completely isolate her. Tate, a boy who used to be friends with her brother is the only one who helps. He teaches her to read and falls in love with her in the process. Eventually, he goes to college and never comes back, leaving Kya alone and budding a new romance with town ‘hero,’ Chase Andrews.

Things end and Chase is later murdered, and Kya is charged for the crime. Through the trial, and other events that follow, you find out the shocking truth about the “marsh girl.”

I loved the form of the novel, having two stories go on at once; the past and the present. It kept the suspense going. In addition, I loved the surprise and conclusion at the end that wrapped the novel up in a very satisfying way. This is definitely a one-of-a-kind plot!

RATING: * * * * *

Genre: Historical Fiction

THIS IS A MUST READ. Whatever is next on your reading list, put this one first. It is truly a work of art. It is so well-written and beautifully crafted. Yes, it’s a novel that requires your full attention, but it is so, SO worth it. This novel is what reading is all about.

It follows the narratives of three different women before, during, and after WWII; Caroline, Herta, and Kasia. Caroline is a wealthy woman who lives in New York and works to provide aid to France during the war, while Kasia is a Polish girl taken to a concentration camp in Germany. Lastly, Herta is a German doctor who kills and operates on these poor girls, known as “The Rabbits,” (a group which really existed), one in which is Kasia. You will be shocked at how all three of their lives become intertwined.

Each narrative does such an amazing job of giving a great depiction of each of these very different lives. The diction and sentence structure is beautiful, the research is exquisitely done, and the emotions are real. I’d recommend this novel to anyone and everyone, regardless of your preferred genre.

I’ve read my fair share of WWII and holocaust novels, but this one did something special that none of the previous ones have. It showed the “afterward” as well. Often times, we read about the horror done to others, that we forget the horror and pain continued even after the war was declared “over.” Pain doesn’t simply go away. Lives must be rebuilt, family’s must be relocated and reconnected. This novel is thought-provoking and not only gives you insight into humanity, but it will teach you things about WWII as well that most novel’s fail to recognize.

“The Death of Mrs.Westaway” By: Ruth Ware
MARCH 7, 2019
LYLA LAYNE
EDIT"“THE DEATH OF MRS.WESTAWAY” BY: RUTH WARE"
RATING: * * *

Genre: Mystery/Thriller

Up to this point, Ruth’s novels have been “one for two” for me; one in which I loved (“The Woman in Cabin 10”), and the other two which I haven’t liked too much (“The Lying Game”, and “In a Dark, Dark Wood”). With this newest novel, I feel a bit indifferent about it. The reason for this is because towards the end, the plot definitely does pick up; however, it took too long to do so.

Therefore, I’ve come to the conclusion that Ruth Ware just isn’t that good of a literary writer per say. Her plots are good and intriguing, but she isn’t able to execute them as well as authors such as Gillian Flynn.

This story was about the mysterious past of the main character, Hal Westaway’s, mother who recently passed. Hal must uncover if she is truly entitled to the will of her supposed grandmother or not. She takes a trip to an eerie mansion and is surrounded my strangers who she must act like are her family. Strangers that are much more dangerous than she realizes. You will later find out that each character is connected to Hal and her mother in various ways, ways that will eventually expose themselves and unravel the truth to Hal. She is left to fight for her life.

I do have to say that Ruth does do a great job of building tension, for I found myself holding my breath near the end, BUT I’m never completely satisfied with her endings. I want more plot and events, and less repetition of rambling thoughts.

RATING: * * * *

GENRE: Mystery/Thriller

As I mentioned in a previous post, I prescribed to a monthly box called Scriblr, and this was another book I received in one of the boxes.

I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it for people that are looking for a dark psychologically thrilling novel. The narrator, Sean, is extremely unreliable in that he is essentially a psychopath who has mistakenly been diagnosed with schizophrenia. He has thrilling thoughts of violence and killing people despite his mind trying to push them away. To top it off, he’s killed before which is what makes him Annabelle’s next target; a psychopath in her own, unique way. She is the true mystery of the story, one that you won’t see coming.

I love the unexpected plot that twists and turns throughout the novel, dodging mystery/thriller cliche’s along the way. It goes against the usual “thriller” narrative which made it even more suspenseful and enjoyable.

I do wish there was more elaboration at the “year later” part of the conclusion, specifically what happens to certain characters that you are somewhat left hanging about (i.e. the mother). Overall, her writing style, diction, and plot are so well constructed that those are just picky opinions and my own writing style getting in the way.

RATING: * * * * *

GENRE: Self-Help

I’m not one for self-help books, but this book blows that genre out of the water. THIS IS A MUST READ, no matter who you are, where you are in your life, or what your outlook is. Dr. Dispenza does an impeccable job mixing science with his theories and the main goal of the book.

He touches on his past and how he essentially was able to heal his back and prevent paralysis when no other doctors said he would walk again. He does this all with his mind. Right there, I’m sure I lost many of you with that last line, but it’s not the “mind” you’re thinking. He doesn’t have superpowers, he didn’t find some greater god to heal it, he used the SCIENCE of our bodies which is our mind.

You will learn so much in the first half of this book from the way our thoughts have different effects on our bodies physical conditions, to how our neurons fire and effect us. You will learn that just like addiction to drugs or alcohol, our minds & bodies can become addicted to anger, negative emotions, etc. And, that once we assign that behavior to a past memory, we will be living in the past, because we will continue to assign that behavior to that same event that is happening tomorrow, or next week, before ever truly experiencing it in the present.

So, whether you have anxiety, depression, anger, problems with negativity, back pain, chronic pain, all the way to conditions such as MS or Parkinson’s, this book is more than worth the read. Worst case scenario, you step away from this book having learned something about the world, our bodies, and yourself. Best case scenario, this book will have an every lasting impact, and positive change on your life as a whole.

This book changed my life, and if you have the open-mind and right attitude, it can change yours too.

A special shoutout to anyone that is into buddhism or mindfulness, I have read my fair share of those books because it is something I am very interested in; however, this is the first book to really click for me in terms of compassion, open-mindedness, and truly finding the steps to change my way of life to one that is happier and healthier.

This was a pretty painful read … one in which I would NOT recommend. I literally could not finish it, which is an extremely rare thing for me.

It is about a girl named Hanna, who is a doctor that repairs and inspects ancient historical artifacts. She travels to Savarejo to inspect a one-of-a-kind Haggadah, that turned up after the war. It is a rare Jewish book that is used during psssover. Throughout the novel, it switches from Hanna’s present journey, to moments of the past that serve as explanations/stories for each new evidence she uncovers in the book.

Overall, it isn’t bad writing by any means, for I think that the form, diction, and sentence structures were very well executed. It is more an issue of plot. You would have to be extremely interested or knowledgeable about the history that the novel touches on, in order not to get lost or lose interest. For me, despite loving historical fiction, this novel was way to boring and lacked a connected, intriguing plot to move it forward.

The idea was there, but the execution was not.

“Once and For All” By: Sarah Dessen

EDIT"“ONCE AND FOR ALL” BY: SARAH DESSEN"
RATING: * * * *

Genre: Realistic Fiction/Romance

This is definitely a classic Sarah Dessen teen romance novel. So, if you’re not a fan of Sarah Dessen or teen romance novels, this is definitely NOT the book for you. Reading this was a bit of reminiscing for me, and I loved the simplicity of the way the plot played out; yet, there is still a lot of complexity to it.

The novel is about a teenage girl, Louna, who tragically lost the love of her life and is working to rebuild on that when an unexpected person, Ambrose, finds his way into her life. They both are stuck working for Louna’s mothers’ wedding planning business during the summer before Louna is set to go off to college.

Sarah does a great job with revealing parts of Louna’s past and lost love, Ethan, while continuing on with her present life. This adds a lot of suspense, as well as depth to her as the main character. Sarah also does a magnificent job with the development of characters such as Ambrose in the novel that will make you laugh throughout.

I do wish that there had been more detail added to the conclusion of the novel, because I feel like we were led up to that moment (don’t want to spoil the end) the whole time and it ended too abruptly. I wanted to feel the moment more and really be able to visualize it.

Additionally, I liked the continuous theme of having it take place where they worked as wedding planners, surrounded by love. Ever since I was a little girl, I’ve always admired & enjoyed Sarah Dessen’s books, and this one was no exception!

“Kill the Queen” By: Jennifer Estep

EDIT"“KILL THE QUEEN” BY: JENNIFER ESTEP"
RATING: * * * *

GENRE: Fantasy

I recently subscribed to a monthly writer’s box called Scriblr, where they send you various stuff each month, including a new novel. This was one of the novels sent to me by them, and while it is a rare fantasy read for me, I enjoyed it very much. I was able to finish this novel in a day. It is definitely YA and geared towards a teenage population. I’d classify it as a “guilty pleasure read,” something that you enjoy and is entertaining, but isn’t up to literary standards as other books such as Jodi Picoult novels.

It’s about a girl named Evie, an heir to the throne, who witnesses her cousin massacre everyone to become queen. Evie escapes without anyone knowing, and spends the rest of the novel in hiding to train for the day she can royally challenge her cousin, kill her, and protect her people of Bellodona from the waning destruction in their future. To do this, she must become a gladiator in the group, “Black Swan,” and train with the best fighters around.

In this novel, there is suspense, romance, action, and more, and once you get into this imaginary world, you will find yourself stuck in it.

While Jennifer does a little too much “telling,” as us writers would say, she still is able to create a very intriguing plot and magical world, while also including humor and romance. She gets you in the perfect place where you know who the characters are, but you’re left wanting to know MORE about them.

I’d recommend this if you’re looking for an easy fantasy read that you won’t want to put down. Despite not being the biggest fantasy fan, I am very excited for the sequel, “Protect the Prince,” to come out this year!

EDIT"“TUMBLEWEEDS” BY: LEILA MEACHAM"
RATING: * * * * *

GENRE: Realistic Fiction

Overall, I really enjoyed this novel. While it is rather long, I feel like it went by too quickly. It’s a novel about love, pain, regret, jealousy, sorrow, loss, anger, and more. Essentially, it’a about everything that makes us human.

To be more specific, it is about three friends; Cathy, John, and Trey, who become extremely close when Cathy moves to their small town of Tersey, Texas (newly orphaned), to live with her grandmother. An accidental death and unforeseen pregnancy, shake up the small town and change the three kids lives forever. The novel continues into their adult lives, showing how their childhood events, mixed with lying, deceit, and misunderstanding, have effected them. You won’t ever be able to guess what happens next.

I loved this novel because it spoke to humanity and everyday emotions and mistakes that we all have. It is extremely different from novels I tend to read, and therefore, it truly was a breath of fresh air. Additionally, Leila did such an amazing job with sentence structure and the flow of her writing. Being as picky with diction as I am, I was very impressed with her work.

At first, you may want to know more thoughts of each character, but not knowing as much is what functions best in this novel. Even the ending was devastatingly realistic. The novel held integrity to the end!
